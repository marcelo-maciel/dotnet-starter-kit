# Web security & request governance

CORS, security headers, rate limiting, idempotency, quota enforcement. `src/BuildingBlocks/Web/` + `Quota/`.
For auth/JWT/permissions see `modules/identity.md`; for the global exception handler see `api-conventions.md`.

## CORS (`Web/Cors/`) — the SignalR gotcha

Policy `FSHCorsPolicy`. When `CorsOptions.AllowAll=true` it uses **`SetIsOriginAllowed(_ => true).AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod().AllowCredentials()`** — deliberately **NOT `AllowAnyOrigin()`**. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is illegal with credentialed requests, and **SignalR's negotiate always runs credentialed**, so `AllowAnyOrigin()` silently breaks SignalR while REST keeps working. Never "simplify" it to `AllowAnyOrigin()`. `UseHeroCors()` runs **before** `UseHttpsRedirection()` so OPTIONS preflight isn't 307-redirected.

## Security headers (`Web/Security/`)

`UseHeroSecurityHeaders()` sets `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy`, HSTS (HTTPS), and a CSP. `SecurityHeadersOptions.ExcludedPaths` defaults to `["/scalar","/openapi"]` (they manage their own scripts) — keep those excluded.

## Rate limiting (`Web/RateLimiting/`)

Chained partitioned fixed-window limiter: **tenant → user → IP** (defaults 1000 / 200 / 300 per 60s) + a stricter named `"auth"` policy (10/60s). Health paths are unlimited. Rejection → 429 + ProblemDetails + `Retry-After`. `RateLimitingOptions.Enabled` is read **eagerly** — when false the middleware is skipped entirely (tests set it via env var before host build).

## Idempotency (`Web/Idempotency/`)

Opt-in per endpoint with **`.WithIdempotency()`**. Reads the `Idempotency-Key` header (max 128 chars, `DefaultTtl` 24h); replays return the cached status, body and the allow-listed headers (`Location`, `ETag`) plus `Idempotency-Replayed: true`. Cache key is tenant-scoped (`CacheKeys.IdempotencyEntry`) and probe and write share one `IDistributedCache` + key + serializer — asymmetry there makes replay silently never engage. Only **2xx** is stored: a failure isn't a record of a committed side effect, and caching it would lock the key out for the full TTL. The store happens **before** the body reaches the client and on `CancellationToken.None`, so a client that times out and retries replays instead of re-executing. Concurrent duplicates are serialized by an in-flight reservation (Redis `SET NX`, else in-process) on the short `ReservationTtl` (default 1m, must outlast the slowest handler); a duplicate still in flight gets **409**. Reserve and release both fail open. Put it on POSTs that must be replay-safe (e.g. CreateTenant).

## Quota enforcement (`Quota/`)

`QuotaEnforcementMiddleware` charges 1 `ApiCalls` unit per request via `CheckAndRecordAsync`; over-limit → 429 + ProblemDetails + `Retry-After`, and sets `HttpContext.Items[QuotaRejected]` so auditing can tag it. Resources: `ApiCalls` (counter), `StorageBytes`, `Users`, `ActiveFeatureFlags` (gauges). Skips health/metrics, unresolved tenants, and the root tenant. **Pipeline:** runs after auth (needs tenant) and after the rate limiter. Inject `TimeProvider` (not `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`) for any time math here — the subsystem is `TimeProvider`-based.

`IQuotaService`: `CheckAsync` (no mutation), `RecordAsync` (increment), `CheckAndRecordAsync` (atomic — won't increment past the limit). Store: Redis (`RedisQuotaService`) or per-process `InMemoryQuotaService` (dev/test). `NoopQuotaService` when disabled.
